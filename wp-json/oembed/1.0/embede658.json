The quiet glances, the inside jokes, the way couples interact when they think no one\u2019s watching. There\u2019s something fascinating and beautiful about the little dynamics that make every relationship completely its own. I love turning those into images that feel honest, emotional, and true to you. My approach is pretty simple: I want your photos to feel like you. The real, unfiltered version, not the overly posed version that makes your jaw cramp. Whether you\u2019re giggling your way through vows or stealing a quiet moment at the end of the night, I\u2019m there to capture it with care and intention (and probably a quiet \u201cOMG this light\u201d to myself). My favorite wedding moments Some parts of a wedding just hit me right in the feels every time. First Look There\u2019s something about the anticipation, the deep breath, and then the instant joy when you finally see each other, it gets me every single time. Vows Whether you\u2019re keeping it traditional or writing your own, this is the moment where everything else fades away and it\u2019s just the two of you. Speeches I can\u2019t help it. I live for the heartfelt, sometimes hilarious stories from family and friends. They always tell me more about who you are as a couple. Some things I particularly love Nontraditional wedding rituals Thoughtful DIY decors Beach sunsets Cheesecake and tiramisu (bonus if homemade) Experimenting with new recipes Hotpot Spontaneous weekend trips Colorful fall foliage If I weren\u2019t a wedding photographer\u2026 I\u2019d probably be running a cozy little cat cafe, complete with lattes, pastries, and adoptable cats for anyone who falls in love mid-sip. (Working name: Fur Real Delicious. Still workshopping it.) My vibe Laidback, supportive, and easy to be around. I\u2019ll gently guide you when you need direction, and quietly blend into the background when you\u2019re in the moment. I\u2019m the kind of person who\u2019ll straighten your hair, make sure you\u2019re hydrated, and keep an eye out for the little things so you don\u2019t have to. Let\u2019s get to know each other If you\u2019re looking for relaxed, candid photos and a photographer who\u2019ll show up with care, calm energy, and a focus on authentic moments and real emotions, we might be a great fit. I\u2019d love to hear about your plans, your story, and maybe your favorite dessert to make; bonus if you share your recipe. Contact"}
