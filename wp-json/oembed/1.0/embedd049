Andrew and Max&#x2019;s Belle Mer wedding was one of those days where the light, the breeze, and the energy of everyone around them felt like a celebration of love in its truest form. As a gay wedding photographer, I&#x2019;ve photographed plenty of beautiful moments, but this day in Newport is one I&#x2019;ll always remember. The ceremony by the ocean The ceremony space was framed by a chuppah of white orchids and driftwood, soft and organic against the sparkling backdrop of the bay. Guests gathered as the sun started dipping lower, casting a golden glow over the lawn. There&#x2019;s something magical about that light&#x2014;you could feel everyone holding their breath as Andrew and Max walked down the aisle, both in classic black tuxes, looking like they&#x2019;d stepped out of a magazine but smiling like they were just so happy to be home. belle mer gay wedding newport ri belle mer gay wedding ceremony mom walk down aisle belle mer gay wedding ceremony newport ri belle mer same sex wedding ceremony belle mer gay wedding ceremony newport belle mer same sex gay wedding ceremony Portraits by the Newport Harbor After the vows and cheers, we slipped away for portraits by the water. The harbor was calm, boats bobbing in the distance, and the sky gave us that perfect Newport sunset. The two of them just sank into each other, and those quiet moments of connection are the heart of any wedding gallery for me. No posing, no performing&#x2014;just Andrew resting his forehead against Max&#x2019;s, both grinning like kids. belle mer gay wedding newport ri belle mer gay wedding newport ri belle mer gay wedding newport ri The hora and dance floor energy Their first dance was sweet and slow, but once the hora kicked off, things got wild in the best way. Seeing Andrew and Max lifted high on chairs while everyone circled around them&#x2014;pure joy. Reception highlights at Belle Mer The reception was a mix of elegance and fun. Candlelight flickered against soft white linens, seashell accents tied everything back to the coastal theme, and the dance floor? Completely alive. A perfect sunset As the night wound down, we stepped outside for one last photo. The ocean was dark now, but the horizon still held a faint line of color. Andrew and Max stood close, silhouetted against the water. It felt like the perfect ending to a day that was all about love, family, and the beauty of being exactly who you are.
